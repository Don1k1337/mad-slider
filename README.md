## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Don1k1337/mad-slider.git
   ```
   
2. Install the necessary dependencies:
    ```bash
    yarn install
    ```
   
3. Build the project:
    ```bash
    yarn build
    ```

4. Start the project:

   **Note:** _If you make any changes to the TypeScript code (src directory), you need to run ```yarn tsc``` before rebuilding and running the project to compile the updated TypeScript files._

To run the tests using Jest, execute the following command:
   ```bash
   yarn test
   ```
